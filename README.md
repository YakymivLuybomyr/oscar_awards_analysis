# 🏆 Oscar Awards Analysis (1929-2023)


## 📌 Project Overview
This data analysis project explores 94 years of Oscar Award history to uncover trends in nominations, wins, and industry patterns. Using Power BI and SQL, I've transformed raw Oscar data into interactive dashboards that reveal:

- Which films/actors dominated the awards
- Gender disparities in nominations and wins
- How award patterns evolved over decades
